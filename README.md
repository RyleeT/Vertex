## What is this application for?

I am a software engineer who loves learning new languages and frameworks. This is a project I used to improve my skills in various areas which doubled as a showpiece.

## Features

- Kanban board with React-powered drag and drop interface
- Lead manager
- Token authentication and user accounts with Knox
- Private routes via React Router
- Comprehensive backend with Python, Django, Django REST Framework, and PostgreSQL
- Frontend written in Babel powered JavaScript
- Powerful state management through Redux
- A mixture of custom light-weight UI components and Bootstrap 4.5
- Custom webpack setup, without create-react-app or similar
- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure

## What is missing?

There are certain features missing from this application which should exist in a real product. If something is notably absent or not configured to perfection, I probably haven't gotten around to it quite yet.

## Setting up development environment

Instructions coming soon...
